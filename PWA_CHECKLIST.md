For development,
http: //localhost works fine.

**Testing:** Use ngrok (https: //ngrok.com) to test on your phone during development:
    ```bash npx ngrok http 3000 # Open the ngrok URL on your phone ``` **Icons:** The icon-generator.html uses blue (#2563eb) from your manifest. To customize, edit the HTML file's colors.

    **Updates:** Service worker checks for updates every 60 seconds. Users will see an update notification in browsers that support it. ## 🎓 Learning Resources If you want to understand more: 1. **manifest.json** - Defines how the OS treats your app - Web App Manifest Spec: https: //www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/
